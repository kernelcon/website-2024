    "talkDescription": "Your metrics are boring and dangerous. Recycled slides with meaningless counts of alerts, incidents, true and false positives... SNOOZE. Even worse, it's motivating your team to distort the truth and subvert progress. This talk is your wake-up call to rethink your detection & response metrics.\r\n\r\nMetrics tell a story. But before we can describe the effectiveness of our capabilities, our audience first needs to grasp what modern detection & response is and its value. So, how do we tell that story, especially to leadership?\r\n\r\nMeasurements help us get results. But if you're advocating for faster response times, you might be encouraging your team to make hasty decisions that lead to increased risk. So, how do we find a set of measurements, both qualitative and quantitative, that incentivizes progress and serves as a north star to modern detection & response?\r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, you'll walk away with a practical framework for developing your own metrics, a new maturity model for measuring detection & response capabilities, data gathering techniques that tell a convincing story using micro-purple testing, and lots of visual examples of metrics that won't put your audience to sleep.",

This model's wholistic view provides an introduction to Cyber Threat Intelligence, enables detection engineers to focus on the most important threats, and helps analysts orient when investigating malware.

The LLMs are trained on the vulnerable code we've already written, so of course multiple studies have now confirmed that they offer the same vulnerability density.\r\nSecurity today is often already outnumbered by developers at rates like 1000:1. When we started to add LLMs to the developer toolchain, we began barreling towards a comically hopeless situation where the ratio of code developed vs. code secured is no longer tenable.\r\n\r\nThere are too many humans involved in critical chokepoints that have no hope of meaningfully securing the deluge of code that is coming.\r\nI'd like the opportunity to make the case that the only way to keep up is to change our engineering practices and introduce virtual security engineers, powered by a mix of LLMs and traditional technologies.",

Defense runs the gamut from protecting brand-new AI services to the simple exercise of basic hygiene.  Attack employs AI-specific techniques on the one hand, and tried-and-true social engineering (of a sort) on the other.

After all, that is the mindset that differentiates hackers: the desire and capacity to take a piece of technology and twist it to fit our needs. There has been a lot of talk about generative models in the context of social engineering and operational security, but comparatively little discussion of other ways that AI systems might be used as part of a hack. This talk will discuss a recent engagement in which we had to attack a system that interfaced with, among other things, a security camera. We will explain how we implemented a technique that we call a Model in the Middle (ModITM) attack, in which an ML model was inserted as a malicious interloper between a pair of services in order to degrade system integrity.  Additionally, we will discuss how using an ML model in an attack changes the design parameters of both the model and the attack infrastructure. Then, we will generalize the ModITM attack and explain how it can be used in different attack scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this attack is the only publicly available example of using a machine learning model as a component of an attack chain.",

Previous studies have determined that preprocessing attacks, such as image scaling attacks, have been difficult to detect by humans (through visual response) and computers (through entropic algorithms). However, these studies fail to address the real-world performance and detectability of these attacks. The purpose of this work is to analyze the relationship between awareness of image scaling attacks with respect to demographic background and experience. We conduct a survey where we gather the subjects’ demographics, analyze the subjects’ experience in cybersecurity, record their responses to a convolutional neural network model that has been hindered by an image scaling attack of a used dataset. We find in this study that the overall detection rate of the attack is low enough to be viable in a workplace or academic setting, and even after discovery, subjects cannot conclusively determine benign images from attacked images.",
