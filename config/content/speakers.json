In this session, attendees will be introduced to the idea of adversarial AI or adversarial machine learning and attacks to machine learning models. Attendees will learn about some real-world case studies regarding attacks that have impacted top global companies in the industry as well as current open-source industry solutions that aim to increase the security of machine learning algorithms. After the session, attendees will have a better understanding of machine learning's role in the cyber threat landscape as well as measures they can take to secure their organization's machine learning technologies."

In this session, we will examine how threat actors compromise systems and what traces they leave behind. From here, we will look at pivoting off an alert or other indicator, extract high value artifacts and how to quickly analyze them to provide high fidelity indicators. This allows for the rapid containment of an incident.\r\n\r\nAttendees will be shown a demonstration in real time where a responder will pivot from an alert, remotely access an infected system, extract a triage package and then analyze it. You will walk away from this with process and practical workflows that incorporate remote access and analysis tools (all Open or Community sourced) that you can bring back to your own environment."

But before we can describe the effectiveness of our capabilities, our audience first needs to grasp what modern detection & response is and its value. So, how do we tell that story, especially to leadership?\r\n\r\nMeasurements help us get results. But if you're advocating for faster response times, you might be encouraging your team to make hasty decisions that lead to increased risk. So, how do we find a set of measurements, both qualitative and quantitative, that incentivizes progress and serves as a north star to modern detection & response?\r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, you'll walk away with a practical framework for developing your own metrics, a new maturity model for measuring detection & response capabilities, data gathering techniques that tell a convincing story using micro-purple testing, and lots of visual examples of metrics that won't put your audience to sleep."

There has been a lot of talk about generative models in the context of social engineering and operational security, but comparatively little discussion of other ways that AI systems might be used as part of a hack. This talk will discuss a recent engagement in which we had to attack a system that interfaced with, among other things, a security camera. We will explain how we implemented a technique that we call a Model in the Middle (ModITM) attack, in which an ML model was inserted as a malicious interloper between a pair of services in order to degrade system integrity.  Additionally, we will discuss how using an ML model in an attack changes the design parameters of both the model and the attack infrastructure. Then, we will generalize the ModITM attack and explain how it can be used in different attack scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this attack is the only publicly available example of using a machine learning model as a component of an attack chain."

                "abstract": "API keys are everywhere, and are increasingly being abused by threat actors for financial gain.  The improper disclosure of keys is not a theoretical concern; it's a reality that can have catastrophic consequences for account security. As a security engineer, it can be a challenge to detect and respond to leaked API keys. In response to this threat, our research focuses on techniques that leverage intentional API key leaks to test system security properties, assess gaps in telemetry, and produce clean datasets that can be used to detect suspicious activity. Using this approach we are able to fingerprint actor activities and learn about novel behaviors and motivations. The insights gained from this study have enhanced our fraud detection capabilities and identified attackers targeting our platform. This presentation aims to share our findings and methodologies, offering a comprehensive overview of how understanding attacker behaviors can significantly contribute to reinforcing the security framework of any platform."

The LLMs are trained on the vulnerable code we've already written, so of course multiple studies have now confirmed that they offer the same vulnerability density.\r\nSecurity today is often already outnumbered by developers at rates like 1000:1. When we started to add LLMs to the developer toolchain, we began barreling towards a comically hopeless situation where the ratio of code developed vs. code secured is no longer tenable.\r\n\r\nThere are too many humans involved in critical chokepoints that have no hope of meaningfully securing the deluge of code that is coming.\r\nI'd like the opportunity to make the case that the only way to keep up is to change our engineering practices and introduce virtual security engineers, powered by a mix of LLMs and traditional technologies."

While MGM might be the most recently prolific example of where phone based social engineering (Vishing) led to a breach, it certainly wasn't the first, and we at Red Siege see constant success when implementing it on our engagements. Over the last few years I have coerced people to give me access to accounts I didn't own, download and execute several pieces of malware, and even transfer money out of someone elses bank account into my own.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be a practical guide to developing and running vishing campaigns, focusing more on the practical aspects of social engineering and less on the psychology. You can expect to leave this talk with a solid foundation on how to plan and execute a vishing based social engineering campaign, how to document and track success, and most importantly for defenders, how to protect your organization against this threat... all while getting to laugh at some great stories along the way."

This talk will delve into the architecture and implementation of these permission models, providing a clear understanding of how they operate within the Node.js ecosystem. We will explore both the strengths and weaknesses inherent in these systems, drawing attention to critical vulnerabilities and bypass techniques.\r\n\r\nWe will explore several CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) that I was able to uncover that have been fixed, along with a couple issues that are known but remain unaddressed, posing ongoing risks. By examining these security gaps, the presentation aims to equip attendees with the knowledge to better secure their Node.js applications or to motivate others into diving in and help squash some Node.js core bugs."
