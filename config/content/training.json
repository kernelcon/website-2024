Next, basic project creation is discussed on the way to examining a simple binary that allows all of the basic features of Ghidra to be explored. In particular, Ghidra's treatment of stack frames, calling conventions and cross references and their importance to the reverse engineering process are discussed.</p><br /><p>The course then moves on to discuss complex data structures and the Ghidra features that assist in decoding and representing them with examples of arrays, C structs and C++ polymorphic classes and vtables.</p><br /><p>The course concludes with a discussion of Ghidra's collaborative reverse engineering capabilities and the setup of a Ghidra collaboration server, Ghidra's integrated debugger, and an introduction to Ghidra scripting where we will review several of Ghidra's example scripts along with some of the basic scripting APIs.
